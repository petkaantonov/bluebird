##Promise.map

```js
Promise.map(
    Iterable<any>|Promise<Iterable<any>> input,
    function(any item, int index, int length) mapper,
    [Object {concurrency: int=Infinity} options]
) -> Promise
```

Given a finite [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)\(arrays are `Iterable`\), or a promise of an `Iterable`, which produces promises (or a mix of promises and values), iterate over all the values in the `Iterable` into an array and [map the array to another](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_\(higher-order_function\)) using the given `mapper` function.

Promises returned by the `mapper` function are awaited for and the returned promise doesn't fulfill until all mapped promises have fulfilled as well. If any promise in the array is rejected, or any promise returned by the `mapper` function is rejected, the returned promise is rejected as well.

The mapper function for a given item is called as soon as possible, that is, when the promise for that item's index in the input array is fulfilled. This doesn't mean that the result array has items in random order, it means that `.map` can be used for concurrency coordination unlike `.all`.

A common use of `Promise.map` is to replace the `.push`+`Promise.all` boilerplate:

```js
var promises = [];
for (var i = 0; i < fileNames.length; ++i) {
    promises.push(fs.readFileAsync(fileNames[i]));
}
Promise.all(promises).then(function() {
    console.log("done");
});

// Using Promise.map:
Promise.map(fileNames, function(fileName) {
    // Promise.map awaits for returned promises as well.
    return fs.readFileAsync(fileName);
}).then(function() {
    console.log("done");
});

// Using Promise.map and async/await:
await Promise.map(fileNames, function(fileName) {
    // Promise.map awaits for returned promises as well.
    return fs.readFileAsync(fileName);
});
console.log("done");

```

A more involved example:

```js
var Promise = require("bluebird");
var join = Promise.join;
var fs = Promise.promisifyAll(require("fs"));
fs.readdirAsync(".").map(function(fileName) {
    var stat = fs.statAsync(fileName);
    var contents = fs.readFileAsync(fileName).catch(function ignore() {});
    return join(stat, contents, function(stat, contents) {
        return {
            stat: stat,
            fileName: fileName,
            contents: contents
        }
    });
// The return value of .map is a promise that is fulfilled with an array of the mapped values
// That means we only get here after all the files have been statted and their contents read
// into memory. If you need to do more operations per file, they should be chained in the map
// callback for concurrency.
}).call("sort", function(a, b) {
    return a.fileName.localeCompare(b.fileName);
}).each(function(file) {
    var contentLength = file.stat.isDirectory() ? "(directory)" : file.contents.length + " bytes";
    console.log(file.fileName + " last modified " + file.stat.mtime + " " + contentLength)
});
```

####Map Option: concurrency

You may optionally specify a concurrency limit:

```js
...map(..., {concurrency: 3});
```

The concurrency limit applies to Promises returned by the mapper function and it basically limits the number of Promises created. For example, if `concurrency` is `3` and the mapper callback has been called enough so that there are three returned Promises currently pending, no further callbacks are called until one of the pending Promises resolves. So the mapper function will be called three times and it will be called again only after at least one of the Promises resolves.

Playing with the first example with and without limits, and seeing how it affects the duration when reading 20 files:

```js
var Promise = require("bluebird");
var join = Promise.join;
var fs = Promise.promisifyAll(require("fs"));
var concurrency = parseFloat(process.argv[2] || "Infinity");
console.time("reading files");
fs.readdirAsync(".").map(function(fileName) {
    var stat = fs.statAsync(fileName);
    var contents = fs.readFileAsync(fileName).catch(function ignore() {});
    return join(stat, contents, function(stat, contents) {
        return {
            stat: stat,
            fileName: fileName,
            contents: contents
        }
    });
// The return value of .map is a promise that is fulfilled with an array of the mapped values
// That means we only get here after all the files have been statted and their contents read
// into memory. If you need to do more operations per file, they should be chained in the map
// callback for concurrency.
}, {concurrency: concurrency}).call("sort", function(a, b) {
    return a.fileName.localeCompare(b.fileName);
}).then(function() {
    console.timeEnd("reading files");
});
```

```bash
$ sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
$ node test.js 1
reading files 35ms
$ sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
$ node test.js Infinity
reading files: 9ms
```

The order `map` calls the mapper function on the array elements is not specified, there is no guarantee on the order in which it'll execute the `map`er on the elements. For order guarantee in sequential execution - see [Promise.mapSeries](.).
