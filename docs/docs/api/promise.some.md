##Promise.some

```js
Promise.some(
    Iterable<any>|Promise<Iterable<any>> input,
    int count
) -> Promise
```

Given an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols)\(arrays are `Iterable`\), or a promise of an `Iterable`, which produces promises (or a mix of promises and values), iterate over all the values in the `Iterable` into an array and return a promise that is fulfilled as soon as `count` promises are fulfilled in the array. The fulfillment value is an array with `count` values in the order they were fulfilled.

This example pings 4 nameservers, and logs the fastest 2 on console:

```js
Promise.some([
    ping("ns1.example.com"),
    ping("ns2.example.com"),
    ping("ns3.example.com"),
    ping("ns4.example.com")
], 2).spread(function(first, second) {
    console.log(first, second);
});
```

If too many promises are rejected so that the promise can never become fulfilled, it will be immediately rejected with an [AggregateError](.) of the rejection reasons in the order they were thrown in.

You can get a reference to [AggregateError](.) from `Promise.AggregateError`.

```js
Promise.some(...)
    .then(...)
    .then(...)
    .catch(Promise.AggregateError, function(err) {
        err.forEach(function(e) {
            console.error(e.stack);
        });
    });
```
