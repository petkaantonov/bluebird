##Collections

Methods of `Promise` instances and core static methods of the Promise class to deal with collections of promises or mixed promises and values.

All collection methods have a static equivalent on the Promise object, e.g. `somePromise.map(...)...` is same as `Promise.map(somePromise, ...)...`,
`somePromise.all` is same as [`Promise.all`](.) and so on.

None of the collection methods modify the original input. Holes in arrays are treated as if they were defined with the value `undefined`.
