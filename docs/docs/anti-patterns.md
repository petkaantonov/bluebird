##The Deferred anti-pattern

This is the most common anti-pattern. It is easy to fall into this when you don't really understand promises and think of them as glorified event emitters or callback utility. It's also sometimes called the promise constructor anti-pattern or explicit construction anti-pattern. Let's recap: promises are about making asynchronous code retain most of the lost properties of synchronous code such as flat indentation and one exception channel.

In Deferred anti-pattern, "deferred" objects are created for no reason, complicating code.

First example is creating deferred object when you already have a promise or thenable:

```js

myApp.factory('Configurations', function (Restangular, MotorRestangular, $q) {
    var getConfigurations = function () {
        var deferred = $q.defer();

        MotorRestangular.all('Motors').getList().then(function (Motors) {
            //Group by Config
            var g = _.groupBy(Motors, 'configuration');
            //Map values
            var mapped = _.map(g, function (m) {
                return {
                    id: m[0].configuration,
                    configuration: m[0].configuration,
                    sizes: _.map(m, function (a) {
                        return a.sizeMm
                    })
                }
            });
            deferred.resolve(mapped);
        });
        return deferred.promise;
    };

    return {
        config: getConfigurations()
    }

});
```

This superfluous wrapping is also dangerous, any kind of errors and rejections are swallowed and not propagated to the caller of this function.

Instead of using the Deferred anti-pattern, the code should simply return the promise it already has and propagate values using `return`:

```js
myApp.factory('Configurations', function (Restangular, MotorRestangular, $q) {
    var getConfigurations = function () {
        //Just return the promise we already have!
        return MotorRestangular.all('Motors').getList().then(function (Motors) {
            //Group by Cofig
            var g = _.groupBy(Motors, 'configuration');
            //Return the mapped array as the value of this promise
            return _.map(g, function (m) {
                return {
                    id: m[0].configuration,
                    configuration: m[0].configuration,
                    sizes: _.map(m, function (a) {
                        return a.sizeMm
                    })
                }
            });
        });
    };

    return {
        config: getConfigurations()
    }

});
```

Not only is the code shorter but more importantly, if there is any error it will propagate properly to the final consumer.

Second example is creating a function that does nothing but manually wrap a callback API and doing a poor job at that:

```js
function applicationFunction(arg1) {
    var deferred = Promise.pending(); //Or Q.defer() in Q
    libraryFunction(arg1, function (err, value) {
        if (err) {
            deferred.reject(err);
        } else {
            deferred.fulfill(value);
        }
    });
    return deferred.promise;
}
```

This is reinventing the square wheel because any callback API wrapping can and should be done immediately using the promise library's promisification methods:

```js
var applicationFunction = Promise.promisify(libraryFunction);
```

The generic promisification is likely to be faster because it can use internals directly but also handles edge cases like `libraryFunction` throwing synchronously or using multiple success values.


**So when should deferred be used?**

Well simply, when you have to.

You might have to use a deferred object when wrapping a callback API that doesn't follow the standard convention. Like `setTimeout`:

```js
//setTimeout that returns a promise
function delay(ms) {
    var deferred = Promise.pending();
    setTimeout(function(){
        deferred.fulfill();
    }, ms);
    return deferred.promise;
}
```

Such wrappers should be rare, if they're common for the reason that the promise library cannot generically promisify them, you should file an issue.

##The `.then(success, fail)` anti-pattern

*Almost* a sure sign of using promises as glorified callbacks. Instead of `doThat(function(err, success))` you do `doThat().then(success, err)` and rationalize to yourself that at least the code is "less coupled" or something.

The `.then` signature is mostly about interop, there is *almost* never a reason to use `.then(success, fail)` in application code. It is even awkward to express it in the sync parallel:

```js
var t0;
try {
    t0 = doThat();
}
catch(e) {

}
//deal with t0 here and waste the try-catch
var stuff = JSON.parse(t0);
```

It is more likely that you would write this instead in the sync world:

```js
try {
    var stuff = JSON.parse(doThat());
}
catch(e) {

}
```

So please write the same when using promises too:

```js
doThat()
.then(function(v) {
    return JSON.parse(v);
})
.catch(function(e) {

});
```

`.catch` is specified for built-in Javascript promises and is "sugar" for `.then(null, function(){})`. Since the way errors work in promises is almost the entire point (and the only thing jQuery never got right, even if it used `.pipe` as a `.then`), I really hope the implementation you are using provides this method for readability.
